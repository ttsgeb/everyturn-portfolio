<h2>Configurable Kwikset Key</h2>
</div>
<div class='item'>
<div class='cell-text' style:'width:70%;'>
<p>To demonstrate the dangers in posting pictures of your keys on the internet, I modeled this configurable and 3D printable key that can be used directly to open a door.  
Additionally, it can be used with a key cutting machine to make a permament and fully functional replacement key based entirely off of a picture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes use of onshape's user variable system to easily build configurations</li>
<li>Makes use of onshape's configuration panel to allow backing up a bank of owned keys with names and key codes</li>
<li>Designed to match an existing specification</li>
<li>Key root depths determined by use of a datasheet</li>
<li>Alternative model available for a more stable cutting template</li>
</ul>

<div class='cell-text'>
<p>Modifications made to a 3D printer required either relocating the mainboard or extending wiring. 
It was determined that in expected usage, relocating the mainboard would prove beneficial while extending wires introduces points of failure.  
This enclosure was designed to easily and quickly mount to the printer's frame, offer better access to the mainboard, relocate ports and wires away from the user, and be manufactured on the printer itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrates use of onshape's versioning system</li>
<li>Designed to be manufactured entirely with tools the end user is known to have</li>
<li>Interfaces with existing designs and components from multiple manufacturers</li>
<li>Measurements taken both from datasheets and real world observations</li>
<li>Designed with a systems mindset to work optimally in the full application</li>

<h2>CNC Router Spindle Mount</h2>
</div>
<div class='item'>
<div class='cell-text' style:'width:70%;'>
<p>A CNC Router I've been tasked with refurbishing has had failures and inadequate repairs of the spindle mount due to insufficiently robust design complicated operator mistakes.  
The aluminum mount had minimal ribbing and several sharp edges acting as stress risers resulting in fatigue through normal operation and eventually shearing at the interface between the clamp and the dropping adapter.  
While the final failure was likely due to a crash, it was certainly weakened by the design choices in initial manufacture.
This had been repaired by simply bolting a second plate to the back of the broken one, without making any efforts to improve the flaws that caused the initial failure.
To address this, I am redesigning the spindle mount to be more resilient against similar failures in the future, and reworking the machine controls to make crashes harder to accomplish.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of Versioning</li>
<li>Branches in Versioning system used for explorations into manufacturing costs</li>
<li>Designed to address previous failure methods of an undocumented tool</li>
<li>Designed with expected manufacture through CNC milling operations</li>
<li>Features planned to simplify tramming adjustments, enabling easier and more reliable machine calibration</li>
<li>Planned improvements in passive spindle cooling through addition of simple cooling fins to the spindle clamp</li>
</ul>

<h2 class='right'>CNC Laser Cutter Visual Focus Assist</h2>
</div>
<div class='item'>
<div class='cell-img'><a target='_blank' href='https://cad.onshape.com/documents/b994a36bc5aa8e577fa0489d/w/8de0358ca2b56e195adf065c/e/d90a9293a1368daf2e61825b'>
<img src='./image/focus.png'></a><br><p class='caption'>Click on image to view file</p></div>
<div class='cell-text'>
<p>Many CNC laser cutters use mechanical probing for setting the focal distance.  These systems are undesirable as they can foul more delicate materials, drag the workpiece around, and are prone to failure.  
In many cases, the probes are removed entirely, creating a more complicated focusing procedure.  To address this, I designed a mount that mounts two low power laser pointers to the lens assembly.  
This enables rapid and repeatable accurate focusing of the workpiece.  Additionally, the design was made with arbitrary machines and optics in mind so that it can be quickly configured for many different lenses and machines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrates ability to identify and solve problems effectively</li>
<li>Uses onshape's variable and configuration options to quickly modify the design for unknown arbitrary machines</li>
<li>Use of Versioning to update model when conflicts are noticed while retaining the ability to reuse a known good version</li>
<li>Solves problems encountered in real world use in a way that is simple for operators to understand and reduces errors</li>
<li>Designed to be rapidly iterated on and replaced inexpensively through additive manufacture with consumer equipment</li>
<li>Creates a more streamlined operator interface through use of a crosshair lens on one laser, enabling operators to focus by "driving" the dot in the direction of the crosshairs with the HMI jog arrows</li>
<li>Doubles as an indicator of cut location due to the joys of basic geometry</li>

<h2>Desk Mounted T-Handle Hex Driver Holder</h2>
</div>
<div class='item'>
<div class='cell-text' style:'width:70%;'>
<p>Harbor Freight has almost acceptable T-Handle Hex Drivers and an agreeable price, however the stands they include with your purchase are extremely unpleasant to use.  
They require careful alignment of the tool through two slightly oversized holes in sheet metal that are about 30mm apart.  
This model was designed to provide more useful tool storage and organization so that it might actually be used rather than the tools being piled in with projects and wandering off.</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for inexpensive manufacture with consumer level machines</li>
<li>Includes labeling for both SAE and Metric tools depending on mounting orientation</li>
<li>The drivers actually easily slide into the holder and it's a wonderful improvement</li>
<li>It almost distracts you from the fact that your tools are from Harbor Freight</li>
<li>I can not emphasize enough how much I dislike having to line up the key with two barely large enough holes 30mm apart</li>
<li>Could be modified for arbitrary sets, but was not designed with this in mind</li>
</ul>

<h2 class='right'>AC Electronics Testing Station With Variac and Gauges</h2>

<div class='cell-text'>
<p>I found myself using loose wires hanging off of a 1:4 transformer plugged into a variac to test equipment for work too often.  
This is unsatisfactory, so I designed a stand to hold the variac, meters, and shielded banana jacks to have less opportunities to electrocute myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to limit exposure to dangerous voltages encountered daily in an electronics troubleshooting and repair enviornment</li>
<li>Variables used for sizing to enable duplication with differing available components</li>
<li>Demonstrates understanding of properties of transparent acrylic and laser cutting</li>

<h2>Ergonomic and Stable Trombone Stand</h2>
</div>
<div class='item'>
<div class='cell-text' style:'width:70%;'>
<p>An instrument in a case will never be played, so I developed this stand to encourage me to play the Trombone more often.</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrates use of revision system to address issues found in initial prototype</li>
<li>Ergonomic design allows mounting and dismounting without changing from the operating grip</li>
<li>Tripod mount allows simple adjustment of height for seated or standing operation by any player</li>
<li>Uses inherent imbalence of instrument to strengthen grip and increase stability over competing products</li>
<li>More readily ambidextrous than the instrument itself</li>
</ul>

<div class='cell-text'>
<p>Like many people, I enjoy the idea of having a high quality matching furniture set.  I am unsatisfied with the availability of such sets that meet my design sensibilities. 
As an experiment in design, I roughed out this set to consider building it myself.  Circumstances have not yet allowed pursual of this project futher.</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrates ability to work with differing scales, units, and expected manufacturing processes</li>
<li>Carries a consistent design language across multiple units to create a more coherent user experience</li>
